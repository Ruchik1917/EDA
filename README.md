Student Performance Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance using Linear Regression implemented from scratch with only NumPy and pandas. The model takes input features like hours of study, sleep duration, previous scores, extracurricular activities, and practice level to estimate a student's academic performance.

We started with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and clean the data for better model accuracy. After preprocessing, the dataset was split into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio). A custom Linear Regression model was built from scratch without using any machine learning libraries. The model was trained on the dataset, and its performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score. Finally, we used the model to make predictions on sample student data.
